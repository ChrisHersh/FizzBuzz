This is a collection of FizzBuzzes in various languages

Rules:

	Please try to use a function for the mod calculations (for consistancy)
		Some languages are exempt from this like COBOL due to the lack of knowledge about them
	Please do 15=FizzBuzz, 5=Fizz, and 3=Buzz (For consistancy)
	If you want some language uploaded feel free to do a pull request
	If you add a language please add the install/compile/run instructions below (just follow the format)
		Also please assume the OS is Ubuntu/Generic Linux
		If you want to add windows, please add a windows section to each language you want instructions for
	
Feel free to use this code, although I make no guarantees, and I have no idea why you would want to use it.

To compile and run: (Linux is assumed, please update and do a pull request if you want to add windows support)

	Python:
	 	install python3 (python2 should work too)
		run `python python.py`

	Java:
		Install the jdk/jre
		run `javac java.java`
		then run `java java`

	C#:
		install mono
		run `mcs csharp.cs`
		run `mono csharp.exe'

	C:
		install gcc (probably installed already)
		run `g cpp.cpp o cpp`
		run `./cpp`

	C:
		install gcc (probably installed already)
		run `gcc c.c o c`
		run `./c`

	Haskell:
		install ghc
		run `ghc haskell.hs'
		run `./haskell`

	COBOL: (Note: this will produce warnings, but you know... it's cobol)
		install opencobol
		run `cobc x cobol.cbl o cobol`
		run `./cobol`
